## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

The project aims to visualize the swiss transport connections in different parts of the country and provide statistical-graphical visualization on the nodes connectivity, travelling time from station to station and pessenger capacities.

The **overview** of the visualization will be a process of interactive map in modes and graphical figures for statistical story-telling.

The **motivation** behind the idea is to visualize the process of the biggest almost-neutral CO2 transport system work in Switzerland.

The **target audience** is planned to include people who are interested in transportation systems, newtork visualizations, Switzerland and who are just curious about things in world. Will require a basic knowledge to understand the statistical figures.
