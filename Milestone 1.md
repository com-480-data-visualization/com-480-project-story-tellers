# Milestone 1

IDEAS:


1. About the virus

* Part 1: story about the virus


Are the viruses all terrible? Are they all lethal?(not very important) \\
**What are their classifications (we can consider our own classification basis, such as transmission rate, lethality, survival mode\condition, whether there is treatment, etc.)?** 

DataSet we need:\\
Huge enough set for almost all kinds of virus the human knows.\\
https://www.gbif.org/dataset/e01b0cbb-a10a-420c-b5f3-a3b20cc266ad\\
https://search.datacite.org/works/10.15468/i4jnfv


Visualisation: \\
The visualisation of classifications by different x-abscissas, like temperature, transmission rate or something else; 




* Part 2:story about the human and virus

The development / evolution of the viruses; the family/Genomic epidemiology of the viruses, where we can have some examples of covid-19 and other viruses; 

The development of medical technology or the economic input of medical system of different countries in the world;

Comparation between the development of the virus(number of species\number of people infected\) and the developement of the medical technology or econmic input;

DataSet we need:\\
There are a lot in the website


Visualiasation:\\
Trees of  important viruses (Time branch or divergence branch)("I suggest the link in the Source"); The spread\expansion in the world map or in some countries and the evolution of the viruses with the time line; The world map with the medical level(we have to define the judging criteria) and the relation with the virus effect;

Interesting Source:\\

Nextstrain: analysis and visualization of pathogen sequence data\\

Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Map\

The problems:\\
a.There is already many people doing this, the original topic may be important.
b.The dataset will be so big that the preprocessing could be hard


* Part 3: What we will be faced with ?

Can we do some predictions about the future?\\
For example, in the next 50 years, if we change nothing, how it will be ?

visualization:\\
something about the map or the graph will be good enough

Problems:\\
a.The predictive model could be hard or unrealiable
b.Maybe there is not obvious trend for the future
