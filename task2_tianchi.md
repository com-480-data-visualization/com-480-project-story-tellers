# REQUIREMENTS

Two A4 pages describing the project goal.

* Include sketches of the vizualiation you want to make in your final product.
* List the tools that you will use for each visualization and which (past or future) lectures you will need.
* Break down your goal into independent pieces to implement. Try to design a core visualization (minimal viable product) that will be required at the end.

Then list extra ideas (more creative or challenging) that will enhance the visualization but could be dropped without endangering the meaning of the project.

Functional project prototype review.

* You should have an initial website running with the basic skeleton of the visualization/widgets.

## sketches for connectivity

![Connectivity Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-story-tellers/master/pic/connectivity.jpg)

We want to use the Force Directed Graph to show the connectivity of the transportation. As we can see in the graph, the nodes are stations and the edges stand for the connectivity between each two stations. Different colors means different cantons. 

By this graph, of course we can see the location and distance of all stations, which can show the whole transport system in the abstractive way. What we want to tell by this graph is not only **the connectivity** but also the showing of  the importance of different stations at the level of **"necessity"**. This graph will be dynamic and interactive, when you moving one node, all the structure will be distorted caused by the "force" of this node. And we can tell the influence of stations for all the transport system by comparing different levels of deformation.


## tools we will going to use

* API(Google / Trafimage)
* D3
* javascript
* github
* python ?


## Core visualization

Our core visualization will be the map (dynamic) with the transport system of Switzerland. It will show different transport types and the variation/movement of every single transport tool on the lines regular by using one model special. (To avoid doing the same work with Mariam, I just write a little bit, but if it's needed, I will go on)


## extra ideas

If time allows, we want to show the hierarchy of stations by the Radial Tree taking the carbacity and connecticity as the judgement criteria.
